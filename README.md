In [_a bit of thai tunes_](https://www.facebook.com/creatorsgarten/videos/1695835374279309), an algorave event at [Museum Siam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_Siam) that featured algorithmic art and live coding, with visuals projected onto the museumâ€™s facade, we implemented an interactive experiment that allowed visitors to color the museum facade using their mobile phones.
