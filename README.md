# abitofthaitunes-interactive

In [_a bit of thai tunes_](https://www.facebook.com/creatorsgarten/videos/1695835374279309), an algorave event at [Museum Siam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_Siam) that featured algorithmic art and live coding, with visuals projected onto the museumâ€™s facade, we implemented an interactive experiment that allowed visitors to color the museum facade using their mobile phones.

This show has 3 phases.

In the first phase, visitors are invited to color the museum facade.

In the second phase, visitors can choose an icon to show. The previously-selected icon will pop out.

In the final phase, each color corresponds to a note. A mallet sound will be played based on the color of the facade, accompanied by me playing the piano ([using a computer keyboard](https://docs.dt.in.th/webmidicon/midi-keybindings.html)).

Will write this later I guess

```sh
pnpm run dev
```
